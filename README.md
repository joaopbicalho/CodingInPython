### Synonym
Code of an intelligent system that can learn to answer questions like the typical multiple choice question asked in the TOEFL and SAT exams of which word is most similar in meaning to another given word. In order to do that, the system approximates the semantic similarity of any pair of words. The semantic similarity between two words is the measure of the closeness of their meanings. In order to answer the question, the program computes the semantic similarity between the word given and all the possible answers, and picks the answer with the highest semantic similarity to the given word. 

### Gomoku
Implementation of a simple AI engine for the game Gomoku, playedon a 8 × 8 board. In Gomoku, there are two players. One player plays with black stones and the other player plays with white stones. A player moves by placing a stone on an empty square on the board. The player who plays with black stones always moves first. After the first move, the players alternate. A player wins if she has placed five of her stones in a sequence, either horizontally, or vertically, or diagonally.

### Gaussian Elimination
Performs gaussian elimination on a given matrix M

### Gamify
Implementation of a simulator for an app that encourages the user to exercise more by awarding “stars” to the user for exercising. The simulator models how the user behaves, and could be used to try out various strategies for awarding stars.

### GraphTraversal
Implementation of breadth first search and depth first search algorithms in graphs and additional functions such as restarting the graph traversal and a function that returns a list of the nodes in the graph connected to any given node.

### BinaryTree
Includes implementation of code to find the height of a Binary Search Tree, code to print out the nodes of a binary search tree using Breadth-First Search, and an empirical  investigation on the relationship between the number of nodes in a bst tree and the height of the tree by using trees with  randomly generated nodes.

### Fleish-Keid Grade Level
Different functions that deal with processing text files in conjunction to dictionaries. There's a function that opens a text file and prints all the lines in the text that contain a given word. A function that converts a dictionary to a string with the key and value pairs separated by new lines. A function that creates a Python dictionary whose keys are words, and whose values are lists of phones based on the CMU Pronouncing dictionary that contains the list of all the vowel and consonant phones in the dictionary. Also a function that creates a Python dictionary whose keys are phone codes, and whose values are the categories (vowels, stops, affricates, fricatives, liquids, nasals, semivowels).A function that takes in a word (assuming it is in the Pronouncing Dictionary) and the dictionaries made previously, and returns the number of vowels in the word. A function that approximates the number of syllables in a word. And lastly, a function that evaluates the Flesch-Kincaid Readability Grade level of a text.

### Matrix as Lists
Matrices properties and calculations using matrices stored as lists of lists.

### Calculator
